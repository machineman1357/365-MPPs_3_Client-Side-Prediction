# 365-MPPs_3_Client-Side-Prediction

## Info
    This will be a project spanning multiple days.

## Day 1 (2021-01-03)
    - networked player movement

## Day 2 (2021-01-05)
    - naive interpolation by interpolating the other players' position from their current position to the last received position. I call this "naive" because if these is latency between packets, then although the movement is smooth, it still jumps.
